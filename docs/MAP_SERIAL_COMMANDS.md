# Maps and setup over serial

Clock shortcut: authenticated `RTL_UI OPEN CLOCK` opens Settings → System → Set
Clock directly, like tapping Home's time/date or FT8's time/clock chips. Opening
the editor does not set or sync time. Save, Cancel and Sync NTP retain their
existing behavior. Map display itself does not require a set clock.

`RTL_MAP HELP` lists named map commands. Commands are uppercase. Read-only help,
status and lists do not require authentication. Every operation that changes
state requires the existing authenticated serial session; this interface never
pairs a new key. Responses end in a newline.

`RTL_MAP STATUS` and `RTL_LORA_MAP STATUS` provide basic readiness without
authentication. Saved/proposed map coordinates and the LoRa followed-node ID
are included only in an authenticated session. Use the existing session key;
these commands never establish or replace pairing.

The prepared manual-guidance update adds the SD folder, matching filename
requirements and OrcMaps release-page address to the read-only `RTL_MAP HELP`
response. It introduces no new state-changing command or authentication path.

The prepared feature-replay candidate adds `ORC_MAP_REPLAY` to `RTL_MAP STATUS`:
`capacity_bytes` is the optional arena size, `retained_bytes` its complete tile
payload, `tile_hits` the last frame's replayed tiles, and `fallbacks` the tiles
streamed without retaining a complete replay. Zero capacity means normal
streaming. These figures do not themselves establish faster display updates.

Keep the session alive with `PING` at intervals shorter than five seconds,
including while waiting for a command result. A location save can take several
seconds; wait for its final result rather than assuming a short silence means
failure. Reception restart after leaving setup is asynchronous: allow it to
settle, then query `RTL_DRIVER STATUS`.

Successful operations return `RTL_MAP_OK`. Errors are `auth_required`,
`invalid_command`, `busy` or `rejected`. A rejected operation can mean the
wrong screen/step, an active input editor, a camera limit, unavailable storage,
a failed save or an installer gate. Query status for context. An acknowledgement
does not mean an asynchronous render or download has finished.

## Inspect state

Background-status navigation: authenticated `RTL_MAP OPEN DOWNLOADS`
opens Get Maps directly, matching the new dashboard-header map status button.
`RTL_MAP STATUS` reports `downloads=1` while that view is active. Native COM17
navigation and physical header readability pass in `c552111f`.

```text
RTL_MAP STATUS
RTL_MAP LIST
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD LIST
```

Status reports the active picker proposal separately from the saved receiver
location, along with existing map/render/install diagnostics. View modes are
0=picker, 1=inventory, 2=setup; setup steps are 0=Welcome, 1=Network, 2=Location,
3=Maps, 4=Complete. Coordinates are signed E7 integers: degrees × 10,000,000.
`ORC_MAP_SOURCE` distinguishes camera zoom from stored tile zoom.

Local pack listings include the full identity and usability. Preserved older
ORCMAP1 files are unsupported and cannot be selected. Download lists describe
the distinct OrcMaps catalog; `RTL_CATALOG_*` remains the generic data catalog.

## ADS-B map range

```text
RTL_ADSB_RANGE
RTL_ADSB_RANGE 25
RTL_UI ACTION SETTINGS RANGE 50
```

The first command is read-only. Both setters require authentication and use the
shared range action, including an open dashboard and deferred persistence.
Supported radii are 10, 25, 50 and 100 nautical miles. The dedicated setter
accepts exactly one of these numbers; it rejects extra tokens and malformed or
overflowing numbers. This does not add radar rings or a crosshair.

`RTL_ADSB_RANGE_STATUS` reports `range_nm`, `dashboard_range_nm`, `active` and
`pending`. The dashboard value describes its retained state; compare it with
the configured value when `active=1`. `RTL_ADSB_RANGE_OK ... persistence=pending`
acknowledges the action, not a durable NVS write or a completed render. Observe
the settings-save result and a fresh frame, then verify persistence separately.

## LoRa dashboard map

```text
RTL_UI OPEN LORA
RTL_UI ACTION LORA VIEW 3
RTL_LORA_MAP HELP
RTL_LORA_MAP STATUS
RTL_LORA_MAP CENTER RECEIVER
RTL_LORA_MAP CENTER NODE
RTL_LORA_MAP FOLLOW ON
RTL_LORA_MAP FOLLOW OFF
RTL_LORA_MAP PAN 40 -20
RTL_LORA_MAP ZOOM IN
RTL_LORA_MAP ZOOM OUT
```

Help/Status are read-only. Mutations require authentication and the LoRa Map
view to own the display. They return `RTL_LORA_MAP_OK`, or an error ending in
`auth_required`, `invalid_command` or `rejected`. A result acknowledges the
camera action, not a completed render or a saved receiver location.

Pan values are camera pixels: positive east/south, bounded to ±842/±330.
Physical dragging passes the opposite movement through the same handler and
turns follow off. Touch-down alone leaves the camera unchanged. Zoom is bounded
to 0–16 and retains the center; overzoom does not create additional map detail.

The opening map prefers a configured receiver position, then the selected
positioned node. Center Node and Follow require that actual selected node to
have a mappable position; they never silently choose another node. Follow
tracks later positions by node ID even when new traffic reorders the list.
Status appends `following_node=<8-digit-hex-id>` (zero when Follow is off).
If that device disappears or lacks a mappable position, the camera stays put
and shows Waiting Position until the same device returns. The Mercator latitude limit is about ±85.05°; polar
coordinates remain valid node data but cannot supply this regional basemap.
With no mappable position, the dashboard explains the missing coverage.

Status reports active ownership, camera readiness, follow intent, center E7
coordinates and zoom. These describe the dashboard camera, not NVS receiver
coordinates. No map movement changes the saved receiver location. Labels use
the independent `RTL_MAP LABELS LORA ON|OFF` preference.

## Location picker

```text
RTL_MAP OPEN PICKER
RTL_MAP PICKER SET 100000000 200000000
RTL_MAP PICKER ZOOM IN
RTL_MAP PICKER PAN 40 -20
RTL_MAP STATUS
RTL_MAP PICKER SAVE
```

`SET` proposes a location; it does **not** save it. The example is 10°N, 20°E,
not a shipping default. `PAN` moves the camera east/south in screen pixels;
negative values move west/north. Each request is bounded to ±1280 horizontally
and ±720 vertically. `ZOOM` accepts `IN` or `OUT` and respects picker limits.
These operations require an active picker, or its location step in setup.

`SAVE` uses the same Saving feedback and verified location hook as the button.
It returns from the ordinary picker or advances setup only after a successful
save. `RTL_MAP CANCEL` discards the unsaved proposal and closes the map surface.
It does not stop an independently running map download.

## Local packs and labels

```text
RTL_MAP OPEN LIST
RTL_MAP LIST
RTL_MAP SELECT <full-pack-identity>
RTL_MAP RESCAN
RTL_MAP LABELS PICKER OFF
RTL_MAP LABELS LORA ON
RTL_MAP LABELS ADSB ON
RTL_MAP LABELS FT8 OFF
```

Selection requires the local inventory or setup's Maps step, and a usable
listed identity. Selection follows the same storage and navigation hook as
the button. Rescan uses the existing worker and recovery path.

Label preferences are independent and persist across reboot. Their commands
work without opening the corresponding dashboard. A saved change invalidates
the shared map presentation so active consumers repaint. Names still depend on
the map's actual contents and the city-label zoom threshold.

## Setup

```text
RTL_MAP OPEN SETUP
RTL_MAP SETUP NEXT
RTL_MAP SETUP SKIP
RTL_MAP SETUP BACK
RTL_MAP SETUP QUICK
RTL_MAP SETUP FINISH
RTL_MAP CANCEL
```

The wizard uses its existing reception pause/restore lifecycle. A failed pause
rejects opening. `NEXT` and `SKIP` advance one step; `BACK` also handles a location
subview/input. `QUICK` is available on Welcome. `FINISH` is available only on
Complete and saves the setup record before closing. Failed progress writes do
not advance an automatic setup, and failed Finish keeps the wizard open.

Network provisioning and address/network location lookup keep their existing
`RTL_WIFI_*` and `RTL_LOCATION IP|LOOKUP <query>|CONFIRM` commands. This document
does not claim a complete application-wide command audit.

Manual coordinate entry in the wizard displays a proposal after longitude;
SAVE LOCATION explicitly commits it, while Back discards it. The existing
`RTL_ADSB_LOCATION <latitude> <longitude>` decimal-degree command is an explicit
save, now requires authentication, and uses the wizard/picker's verified save
hook. Use `RTL_MAP STATUS` to inspect saved E7 coordinates. Picker `SET` followed
by `SAVE` remains the named proposal/confirmation route.

## Map downloads

Prepared cost instrumentation emits `ORCMAPS_VERIFY_PROFILE` after a normally
returned full-file check (including cancellation/failure). It reports checked
bytes/blocks and read, SHA-update and elapsed microseconds; elapsed includes
scheduling and other verification work. This is source-tested, not yet installed
on COM17. See [measurement limits](evidence/maps/2026-10-24-verification-cost-profile.md).

```text
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD CHECK
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD LIST
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD INSTALL <index>
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD CANCEL
RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD RETRY
```

Use a zero-based index from the current download list. Check, install, cancel
and retry use the same installer APIs and eligibility checks as the UI. Already
installed entries are not reinstalled through this command. Nothing bypasses
catalog trust, archive verification, activation/recovery or storage checks.

Verification feedback adds `verified`, `verify_total` and
`verify_pass` to the read-only `RTL_MAP DOWNLOAD LIST` status line. These are
metadata bytes read by the current quick size/header/root/coverage check and its
check number. The names are retained for serial compatibility; no full archive
scan or payload hashing is performed by the new path. A completed quick check
does not prove every tile is intact. Installed success still requires phase=2,
busy=0 and the installed entry. Older firmware's full-scan timing records remain
historical measurements. `ORCMAPS_VERIFY_PROFILE check=structure` identifies
the new metadata-only measurements; `hash_us` is zero.

Standard scripted builds now explicitly configure the published nonexpiring
production catalog and public key. COM17 `46cf8148` passes production Check and
repeat Check after reboot, preserving settings and existing packs. The actual
543 MB install/resume benchmark used the earlier pilot channel; it is separate
evidence. Low-level manual CMake builds without catalog inputs still reject
Check or return an empty list. These commands do not publish assets.

### Detailed-frame worker timing

`RTL_MAP_STATUS` also reports `ORC_MAP_WORKER yields=... wait_us=...
included_in_total=1 tick_us=...`. The wait is wall time around cooperative
`vTaskDelay(1)`, including time before the worker is scheduled again. It is
already included in frame timings; do not add it to `total_us` or interpret
the remainder as isolated CPU time. Counts reset for each render attempt.

`ORC_MAP_READ_CACHE` reports the completed frame's optional compressed-byte
cache capacity, block hits/misses, and actual backing read calls/bytes. Cache
statistics reset per render; contents survive same-archive pans. Existing
`ORC_MAP_STATUS reads/bytes` remain logical pipeline requests, and `io_us`
includes cache lookup/copy plus any backing read time. A hit counts a 4 KiB
block access, not a complete tile or a displayed frame. Capacity 0 is the
supported direct-read fallback, not a map failure.
